NAME
    Apache2::Banner - a patch for Apache2::ServerUtil

SYNOPSIS
     use Apache2::Banner ();

     $banner=Apache2::Banner::banner;
     $description=Apache2::Banner::description;
     $datestr=Apache2::Banner::date $time;

INSTALLATION
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

DESCRIPTION
    "Apache2::Banner" reimplements a few functions that Apache2::ServerUtil
    didn't get right at least up to mod_perl 2.0.5.

    Future mod_perl versions may fix the problem.

  $banner=Apache2::Banner::banner
    "Apache2::ServerUtil::get_server_banner" should do the trick. But it
    calls the Apache API function only once when Apache2::ServerUtil is
    loaded. That is not correct because the module may be loaded very early,
    for example in a "<Perl>" container in the httpd.conf. Modules may
    register components later. Hence, the Apache2::ServerUtil notion of the
    banner is wrong.

    The *server banner* is influenced by the "ServerTokens" directive.

  $banner=Apache2::Banner::description
    The same here, "Apache2::ServerUtil::get_server_banner" should do it but
    doesn't.

    The *server banner* is not influenced by the "ServerTokens" directive.

    With "ServerTokens Full" banner and description are equal.

  $datestr=Apache2::Banner::date $time
    returns $datestr exactly the same way as the HTTP "Date" header would be
    formatted.

  EXPORT
    None.
